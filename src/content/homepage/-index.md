    content: "If you don’t have control of your business, then your business has control of you. I've been there. And I'm here to tell you, it doesn't have to be this way. I joined a practice with an owner in the midst of burnout, and over the course of six months we reduced his hours by over 40% and gave him time to recover. Once he was rested he wanted to resume his original goal of providing a better practice for both clinicians and patients, and he wanted to grow. Over the next two years we grew revenue by 175%, profits by 488%, while reducing his hours by an additional 25%. At the same time we improved clinician training programs, satisfaction, compensation, and retention, and as a result patient outcomes and satisfaction. We didn’t succeed at the expense of our team, we succeeded with our team."

    image: "/images/service-3.png"
    content: "I have a background in engineering, but found my passion when I pivoted from helping big companies produce parts more profitably to helping medical and paramedical practices to help their patients. The reality for most practices is time is very limited, and they’re lucky to find a few hours a month to spend thinking about how to improve how they do things. I've spent my entire career on efficiency, and the past 5 years focused solely on helping practices to accomplish their goals more efficiently. I’ve consumed countless books, podcasts, and blog posts on this topic, so you don’t have to. I have gotten to see what works across an industry, to help you tame your business, so you can focus on what matters: your patients. I believe what’s good for you, and what’s good for your team, is good for your patients. Taking care of yourself and your team is the way to bring out the best in them, which is what your patients need and deserve."
