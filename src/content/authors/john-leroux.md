## Background

I started working in the medical sector 15 years ago, first for a biomedical company, then running a multidisciplinary group practice, and now as a medical practice consultant.

I have a passion for problem solving and continuous improvement, and my bachelor’s degree in Mechatronics Engineering, which offers me a broad set of tools that have been invaluable throughout my career.

I got into the clinical practice space when I joined a group mental health practice. I joined the team after their third Director of Operations had quit without notice, and the owner was grappling with burnout. The team was working frantically to put out fires, but never seemed to prevent them. They were growing, but that was compounding their problems even faster. 

I brought my toolkit from my past roles in quality control, process automation, and continuous improvement and set to work. We automated, delegated and eliminated tasks to reduce the owner’s workload by over 40%, tasks that weren’t driving their passion or their practice. We improved client care and satisfaction, staff compensation and retention, all the while reducing  improving profitability. Then when the founder was ready for their next chapter, I negotiated a successful exit from the company. This transformation was driven by a focus on the philosophy of Lean and the Kaizen methodology of continuous improvement at every layer of the organization.
